          As you walk the nature path, soft chimes and flickering forest specters respond to your movements, 
          creating a surreal, immersive experience. The Light Portals use repetition, sound, and subtle 
          interactivity to make visitors feel surrounded by living light, blending the natural and the otherworldly 
          to make the Portals feel malleable and alive.

      <h2>Animating Memories</h2>

      <p>
        Do artifacts from the past keep the memories of their users? Our Light Portals are built from 
        reclaimed windows, letting the light of the past shine through and inviting visitors to imagine 
        the homes and families who used these windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This collaborative project blends reclaimed windows and technology to create an engaging light and sound 
        experience. Building on their shared interest for technology, environmental art, and interactive installations, 
        Aaron and Herm invite audiences on a journey through light and sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Light Portals is installed at Cincinnati Nature Center for Light in the Forest through Dec 28.

      <h2>How do they work?</h2>

      <p>The installation is constructed of eight individual wooden frames from reclaimed windows, 
        with programmable multicolor LED strips sealed between two panes and fully waterproofed. 
      </p>
      <p>  
        Each LED responds to data from proximity sensors, changing hue, intensity, and pattern to bring 
        the illuminated “forest specters” to life. 
      </p>
      <p>A programmable synthesizer creates voices and notes based on visitor movement, fading tracks 
        in and out and shaping waveforms for a more immersive experience. Each portal contains its own
        speaker to create an immersive sound experience.

      <h2>Windows and Frames</h2>

      <p>
        The reclaimed windows are from early to mid-century houses. Windows are mounted into simple 2x6 frames. 
        We replaced glass where necessary and recaulked all the panes to avoid breakage.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The LEDs are mounted into the windows on simple garden netting stapled to the 2x6 frame. We 
        experimented with LED layouts in the windows based on the arrangement of the panes 
        to create "spectors" in the windows animated with the LEDs.
      </p>
      <p>  
        Weatherproofing was key to the design. We kept the frame build simple and then caulked all seams. 
        The windows have remained watertight even in several inches of snow. This design has also proved
        to be condensation-free.
      </p>
      <p>
        To diffuse the LEDs, we used diffusion film squeegeed to each pane with some additional adhesive
        to ensure the film did not peel or bubble.

      <h2>LEDs</h2>

      <p>
        Each Portal is illuminated by a two-meter Adafruit NeoPixel LED strip, encased in an IP67-rated silicone sleeve. 
        Each strip contains 120 individually addressable RGB LEDs, allowing light to be precisely controlled at every point 
        along its length.
      </p>

      <p>
        The LED strips are suspended within the frame using garden netting, creating a flexible, non-rigid structure 
        that diffuses the light and softens the geometry of the form.
      </p>

      <p>
        The LEDs are programmed in MicroPython using a mathematically generated noise algorithm that animates across 
        all 120 pixels. Environmental sensors continuously influence this animation. As visitors approach the Portals, 
        the movement accelerates and the color palette shifts, causing the light to respond directly to human presence 
        and proximity.

      <h2>Microcontroller</h2>

      <p>
        Control is handled by a Pimoroni Plasma 2350 microcontroller. This board was selected for its ability 
        to supply both 5V power for the LED strips and 3.3V power for sensors and control electronics, allowing 
        the system to operate from a single controller without additional power regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A distance sensor is connected to the Plasma 2350 via a serial interface. The measured distance value 
        is used by the microcontroller to influence the LED animations and is also transmitted over a second 
        serial connection to a Daisy Seed audio module. Both light and sound respond to the same proximity 
        data, maintaining a direct relationship between visitor movement and system behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming for the Plasma is in MicroPython.

      <h2>Sensors</h2>

      <p>
        We use mmWave radar sensors to detect visitors. Ultrasonic sensors didn’t provide reliable readings 
        for human distance, so we switched to mmWave, which delivers consistent and precise measurements 
        up to five meters.
      </p>

      <p>
        We mount each sensor along the side of the Portals, giving it a roughly 60-degree field of view to 
        detect movement from both the front and back. As people move through the space, the sensors generate 
        a wave of change that passes through the Portals, synchronizing their light and sound in real time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cabling posed a challenge, so we built custom four-foot, four-conductor wires that plug directly 
        into the main board. These allow us to position the sensors cleanly along the Portal frames 
        while keeping the electronics centralized.
